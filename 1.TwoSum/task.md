Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return the indices of two numbers such that their sum equals the `target`.

You can guess:
- that there is always exactly one solution
- that you cannot use the same element twice
- index order does not matter

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]
```
Reason: `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`.
